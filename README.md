# Caption Code Canvas - The Text Editor

## Project Overview

**Caption Code Canvas** is a text editor project designed to incorporate fundamental data structures and algorithms. The primary objective is to create a text editor that can efficiently highlight words that match a given search query. The search functionality will be powered by the **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm** to ensure quick and accurate string matching.

## Learning Objectives

In this project, we aim to achieve the following:

1. **Data Structures Mastery**:
   - Gain a deep understanding of various data structures.
   - Implement and utilize these data structures effectively in the project.

2. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Study and implement the KMP algorithm for efficient pattern matching.
   - Integrate the KMP algorithm into the text editor to search and highlight words.

## Project Phases
