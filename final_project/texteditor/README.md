Usage:

1)  Write Search feature code in search.cpp
    It has to take two arguments, they are
        - first string of path to the file
        - query string
    Load the content in the file which is given as first argument
    Then find the line numbers and index numbers (starting is 1, not 0)
    Print all possiblities one by one
    For example, if possibilities are line 1 index 2 and line 2 index 4,
    print:
        "1 2
         2 4"

2)  Compiple the code using "g++ search.cpp -o seacrh.out"
    (Present search.cpp prints above example)

3)  Run "python3 code_canvas.py". If running gives any errors, download required libraries

4)  Click "Click for a window"

5)  If you can't find buttons, extend the window below (or) maximise the window (or) in "code_canvas.py" 
    and modify "popup_width" and "popup_height" accordingly

6)  Write some text (example text is given in example.txt) and save the text (very important step)

7)  Click search button and enter query. You should be able to see the query words highlighted

8) Use "clear search" button to clear the highlights

9) Note that you have to save the file before search
